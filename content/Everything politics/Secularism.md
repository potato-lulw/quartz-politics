Political Idea that separates religion from state and other aspects of life. It also protects the civil liberties of people. 

Here are some key aspects of secularism: 

- Separation of church and state
    
    This ensures that religious institutions are independent of government influence. 
    
- Equality
    
    Religious beliefs or lack of them should not give anyone an advantage or disadvantage. 
    

- Tolerance
    
    Secularism emphasizes tolerance of all religions and full freedom to all religions. 
    

- No discrimination
    
    Secularism stands for equal opportunities for followers of all religions, and no discrimination and partiality on grounds of religion
