### Issue at hand
Hindu temples are primarily under government control in India *due to the "Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act" which allows state governments to manage and regulate Hindu temples*, while there is no similar legislation to govern mosques, leading to a perception of disparity in control between Hindu places of worship and other religions; this is often criticized as a lack of complete secularism in the legal framework

Advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay (lawyer and BJP spokesperson) filed a PIL seeking for Hindus, Jains, Buddhists, and Sikhs the right to establish, manage and maintain their religious places like Muslims, Parsis, and Christians.

### What does the [[Constitution]] say

Articles 25 and 26 of the Indian Constitution are both related to the freedom of religion, but they differ in some ways: 

- Article 25
    
    This article guarantees freedom of conscience and the right to practice, profess, and propagate religion. It also includes the right to declare one's religious beliefs openly and freely. 
    
- Article 26
    
    This article gives the right to manage religious affairs, including the right to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes. 
    

### Caveat 
The assumption in the ‘free temples’ argument seems to be that the state government can make money off the temples as the respective Acts lay down rules on how the coffers of the temples should be managed. This, however, is not really true for any state. Any donations given to a temple — whether from collections in the _hundi,_ or given privately — go into its bank account. The temples’ budget needs the HR&CE Department’s approval to utilize some funds, however, these funds can only be used for activities related to the temples, and cannot – by law – be pocketed by the officials appointed by the government to the temple trusts and boards.

Therefore, the government cannot take the temples’ income, or put that money to its own use. In fact, in December last year, the Kerala High Court even said that donation from the Guruvayoor Devaswom Board’s coffers to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund to help in COVID-19 relief was [illegal](https://www.livelaw.in/news-updates/guruvayoor-devaswom-funds-cmdrf-illegal-kerala-high-court-167414) 
Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams Chairman YV Subba Reddy tells TNM that in Andhra Pradesh, most temples are run by trusts, which also have government appointed members including a Commissioner. "The government's responsibility is to ensure that temples run smoothly and that the money received by the temple is used for it and its devotees. We don't pay taxes; there is some GST for prasadams and some purchases."

Laxmi Narayanan an advocate from Tamil Nadu, points out that the powers of the Wakf Boards are not very different from HR&CE Departments, and the argument that there is preferential treatment to mosques when compared to temples is incorrect. 

For instance, under the Wakf Act of 1995, the Wakf Board does scrutinise and approve budgets, can appoint or remove the _muttawali_ (a person who takes over the management of a Wakf) in accordance with the Act, set up a Wakf fund and so on – similar to the duties of the HR&CE Department. The Wakf Board [can also decide](http://www.legalservicesindia.com/article/1433/Administration-of-Wakf-in-India.html) what must be done with surplus income from the properties under its management, it must be done in line with the objectives of the Wakf. So, Narayanan says, the scope for malpractice, control, and politicization is as much in the Wakfs as under HR&CE Acts, if not more.
#### Is this against [[Secularism]]?

Laxmi Narayanan argues that the role of the HR&CE Department does not necessarily clash with secularism (separation of state and religion), because the aspects that it takes care of – such as how much provisions should be used, how much money should be allotted for certain activities –  ***are not to do with the religious customs and practices of the temple***. The laws deal more with administrative aspects and accountability, and say that all activities, including utilization of surplus funds, should be done in line with the religious institute’s or Hindu norms.

#### Why was the law made in the first place? 

“There was no smooth transition from the time of kings and kingdoms to the time of the British rule. So, the temples had become cesspools, creating a situation where a few were taking advantage of the big temples. Whoever was powerful, had influence in a place, could practically control a temple. So, there was a need to remove such mafias, regularise, and ensure people’s legacy is preserved. That is why the law came in the first place,” explains P Thiaga Rajan (PTR), a DMK leader and grandson of PT Rajan, former Chief Minister of the erstwhile-Madras Presidency in 1936.
