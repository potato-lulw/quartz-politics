This is an extensive list of the lies the BJP, BJP IT cell and the compromised media has spread over the years. This is in no way a complete list. I keep adding these lies as I see and uncover them in public discourse. 


1. Uddhav Thakrey said "Aurangzeb was a martyr". 
	Although Ex CM of Maharashtra Uddhav Thakrey did say it, it was not the Aurangzeb we know about.
	 
	"Subsequently, the Desk concluded that Thackeray’s two different speeches on the martyrdom of Aurangzeb – a soldier of the Indian Army – were clipped and selected portions of the speeches were used in social media posts to claim that he appreciated Aurangzeb – the Mughal emperor – and called him his brother and a martyr of the country."  - [Link](https://www.ptinews.com/fact-detail/Uddhav-Thackeray-didn%E2%80%99t-call-Mughal-emperor-Aurangzeb-his-brother-during-his-speech;-Claim-shared-in-social-media-misleading=/287160)
	
	Rifleman Aurangzeb belonged to the 4 Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry and was posted at the camp at Shadimarg in Shopian. He was abducted while on his way to meet his family and was killed by militants in Pulwama on June 14, 2018.
