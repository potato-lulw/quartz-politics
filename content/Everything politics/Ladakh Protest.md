**"Delhi Chalo Padyatra"** began from Leh in September. Around 120 people along with [[Sonam Wangchuk]] is marching in protest from Leh to India's capital New Delhi. 
### Cause of protest

Sonam Wangchuk has in recent years shows grievance regarding the autonomy of the administration of Ladakh. In 2019, Wangchuk wrote a letter to the Ministry of Tribal Affairs to grant Scheduled Area status to Ladakh under the [Sixth Schedule](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/protest-held-in-kargil-over-sixth-schedule-statehood-demand-101710959024017.html) (Statehood) of the Constitution of India.

The same year, students in Ladakh protested for the same demand. The protests were supported by former MP Thupstan Chhewang, who then created the Leh Apex Body (ABL). The protests were also backed by the Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA).

Wangchuk has asserted that the protections under the Sixth Schedule for Ladakh were a poll promise of the BJP in the 2019 general elections, and the government should keep its word.

### Actions by the Center


1. In an earlier hunger protest in March 2024, there was no resolution and the protest ended with the protesters ending the hunger strike looking at the deteriorating state of Wangchuk.
2. Detention of the foot protesters as soon as they entered Delhi on 1st October, 2024. 

### Why 6th Schedule 

The Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution provides **autonomy to tribal areas** for self-governance, focusing on **preserving their culture, environment, and resources**. It is currently applicable to *Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram*. The schedule empowers Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) with legislative, judicial, executive, and financial powers, allowing them to govern matters **like land use, cultural preservation, education, and local administration**.

Ladakh, with a 97% tribal population, is demanding inclusion under the Sixth Schedule for similar autonomous powers. After the revocation of Article 370 in 2019, **Ladakh lost its special constitutional protections**. Protestors, led by environmentalist Sonam Wangchuk, argue that Sixth Schedule status would enable sustainable development and the protection of the region's unique environment and culture, particularly in the face of climate change. Despite previous promises by the ruling BJP, the central government has so far refused this demand, leading to ongoing protests. Ladakh’s inclusion would grant its Hill Development Councils enhanced powers, but the government hesitates due to potential security concerns regarding control over land and resources.

In contrast, the Fifth Schedule, which applies to other tribal areas in India, offers less autonomy, with tribal advisory councils playing a more limited role compared to the Sixth Schedule’s more comprehensive governance structure.
